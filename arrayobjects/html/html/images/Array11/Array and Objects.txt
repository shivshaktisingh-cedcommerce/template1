In this task , we have given a array by using the data inside we have to implement few operatios:


Creating Table at run time:At every time when a user click on add to cart , called a function (add to cart) which has parameter which is passed dynamically during rendering all the products defined in array using loop.
Using (i) and this keyword and attribute which is defined at rendering array data at client side  , stored an id into a variable which is passed to add to cart(id).
Using that id i am first checking attribute(status) is exist or not , if status is not exist then i created a row and if it exist then changed only quantity and reflect it to HTML. 



Manually changing Quantity:  stored the value which is given in input box using id of input box and reflect it back using same id.



Empty the Cart:  To empty the cart used click function and id given to empty button and (id of table).empty() function.


Delete the Row: To delete a row , passed an id when someone clicked on delete button and using that id removed that row.
